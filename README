  This python3 script lets you mirror security updates which is something that is not always supported by other
  mirrors, probably for security reasons. They want you to always go direct to the original debian repository when
  you can. It might also allow you to mirror general releases, but I haven't tested that yet.

  Run ./RepositoryMirror.py -h to see basic usage
  Run ./RepositoryMirror.py -create : Initialise the Repository Mirror (default security.debian.org)
  Run ./RepositoryMirror.py : Shows amount of data to update missing packages
  Run ./RepositoryMirror.py -fetch : Actually goes and fetches the missing files - initially may be 1-2 Gigabytes!

  Note:
      Option -v will add more details to operations
      Edit RM.cfg to alter the repository/Distrubution/architectures to be mirrored

  Use the local mirror by adding in a line such as:

# local security mirror
  deb file:///local/work/RepositoryMirror/security.debian.org/ wheezy/updates main contrib non-free

  And then the usual :

    apt-get update
    apt-get upgrade

  Note: I get the following apparently harmless "Ign file" lines:
# apt-get update
Ign file: wheezy/updates Release.gpg
Get:1 file: wheezy/updates Release [102 kB]
Ign file: wheezy/updates/contrib Translation-en
Ign file: wheezy/updates/main Translation-en
Ign file: wheezy/updates/non-free Translation-en
Reading package lists... Done

  The first non-blank part of the deb line is a URL so you can make the directory available by other methods such
  as ftp or http to share the repository remotely.
  e.g. Add something like this to /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-default

    Alias /debs/ "/local/work/debs/"
    <Directory "/local/work/debs/">
        Options Indexes MultiViews FollowSymLinks
        AllowOverride None
        Order deny,allow
        Deny from all
        Allow from 10.0.0.0/16
        Allow from 10.1.0.0/16
        Allow from 127.0.0.0/255.0.0.0 ::1/128
    </Directory>

   Then create a symbolic link in the /local/work/debs/ to point to the security.debian.org directory

ln -s ../RM/security.debian.org ../debs/security.debian.org

   Then reload apache configuration with:

/etc/init.d/apache2 reload

    Note:
     * I had to fix the permissions to allow apache to access this via: chmod -R a+r security.debian.org
     * The apt-get update command reported the files as being untrusted perhaps because the signature/dates or
     something were not matching.

   * This is first cut untested except on security updates - be-aware hopefully it is useful.
   * Patches/fixes welcome.
